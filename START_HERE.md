## 🎯 Your Path Forward

### **Option 1: Set Up Backend NOW** ⭐ (Recommended)
**Time**: 20 minutes
**What you get**: Fully working platform with database, auth, storage

**Follow this guide**: Open **`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`** and follow step-by-step

**You'll set up**:
1. ✅ Supabase (database + auth + storage) - 10 min
2. ✅ Resend (email service) - 3 min
3. ✅ Perspective API (content moderation) - 4 min
4. ✅ hCaptcha (bot protection) - 3 min

**After setup, tell me**: "Supabase setup complete!"

Then I'll build:
- Organization registration form
- Email verification system
- Project submission with image upload
- Admin dashboard
- Dynamic homepage with real data

---

### **Option 2: Just Browse The Demo** 👀
**Time**: 1 minute

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

You can see the frontend working with dummy data.

**Limitations without setup**:
- ❌ Can't register organizations
- ❌ Can't submit projects
- ❌ No database (shows hardcoded 10 projects)
- ❌ No file uploads
- ❌ No authentication
