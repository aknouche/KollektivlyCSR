# Kollektivly - Development Guide

## 🎯 What We Do
Platform connecting Swedish companies with verified föreningar. Companies support samhällsprojekt with guaranteed impact reporting through AI-verified escrow payments.

**Core Value**: "No Report, No Payment" - We hold grant money and only release it when AI verifies impact reports.

## 💰 Business Model

### Free Platform
- Companies browse/contact föreningar: **FREE**
- Föreningar list projects: **FREE**

### Revenue: Escrow + Verification Service
Companies pay **service fee ON TOP of grant amount** (not deducted from it).

**How it works**:
1. Company commits 50,000 SEK grant to förening
2. Adds 3,500 SEK service fee (7%)
3. Total charged: **53,500 SEK**
4. Kollektivly receives: **3,500 SEK** (immediately)
5. Grant held in **escrow**: **50,000 SEK**
6. Förening submits milestone reports
7. **AI verifies** reports (completeness, quality, impact claims)
8. **Payment released** only when verified
9. Company gets **auto-generated ESG report**

**Verification Tiers**:
- **Basic (4%)**: Simple escrow + format checks - 2,000 SEK on 50K grant
- **Standard (7%)**: AI verification + ESG reports - 3,500 SEK on 50K grant ✅ Recommended
- **Enhanced (10%)**: + Legitimacy checks + custom support - 5,000 SEK on 50K grant

**Revenue Example**:
- 100 grants/month at avg 50,000 SEK
- 70% choose Standard (7%)
- Monthly: 245,000 SEK
- Annual: **2,940,000 SEK**
- Break-even: 4 grants/month

## Key Decisions

**✅ What We Do**:
- Transaction-based (not subscriptions)
- AI-verified escrow (not just payments)
- Fee ON TOP of grant (not deducted)
- Simple tiers (not complex add-ons)
- Self-service (not enterprise sales)

**❌ What We Avoid**:
- Subscriptions (barrier to entry)
- CSRD compliance software (too complex)
- Deducting fees from grant (bad optics)
- Manual verification (doesn't scale)

---

## Competitive Advantage

**Without Kollektivly** (traditional grants):
- No verification → risk of misuse
- Manual follow-up → 10-20 hours/grant
- No ESG docs → hard to report impact
- Inconsistent reporting → wasted time

**With Kollektivly**:
- AI-verified reports → guaranteed impact
- Zero follow-up → automated process
- Auto ESG reports → ready for stakeholders
- Standard format → clean data
- **Time saved**: 15 hours = 3,000+ SEK value
- **Cost**: 7% fee on 50K = 3,500 SEK

**Value delivered > Price charged** ✅
