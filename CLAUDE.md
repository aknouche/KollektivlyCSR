- ‚úÖ Partner with ESG consultants (they use our platform for client data)
- ‚úÖ "CSRD-Ready" badge (your data can feed into their reports)
- ‚úÖ Focus on evidence, not compliance (let their consultants do the hard work)

## üîÑ Simple Development Workflow

### **Current Approach: Option 1 (Ultra Simple)**
**Philosophy**: Keep it simple, add complexity only when needed

### **Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
1. npm run dev              # Work locally at localhost:3000
2. npm test                 # Ensure tests pass
3. git add . && git commit -m "description of what you changed"
4. git push origin main     # Goes live automatically via Vercel
5. Check live demo, share URL with stakeholders
```

### **Before Each Development Session**
```bash
git pull origin main        # Get any updates
npm run dev                 # Start local development
```

### **When to Add Complexity**
- ‚ùå **Not now**: Learning phase, single developer
- ‚úÖ **Later**: When you have team members joining
- ‚úÖ **Later**: When simple workflow causes real problems
- ‚úÖ **Later**: When you have users reporting bugs from broken deployments

### **Future Workflow Evolution Plan**
1. **Phase 0 (Now)**: Direct to main branch, auto-deploy
2. **Phase 1**: Add `develop` branch when backend development starts
3. **Phase 2**: Add feature branches when team grows
4. **Phase 3**: Add code review when complexity increases

| Service | Free Tier | Usage Estimate | Cost |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------|
| **Vercel Hosting** | Unlimited bandwidth | Static + SSR pages | 0 SEK |
| **Vercel Postgres** | 256MB, 60h compute/mo | ~50 orgs, 200 projects | 0 SEK |
| **Vercel KV** | 256MB, 30k commands/mo | Sessions + favorites | 0 SEK |
| **Vercel Blob** | 500MB storage | Project images | 0 SEK |
| **Resend Email** | 3,000 emails/month | Verification + notifications | 0 SEK |
| **Perspective API** | 1M requests/day | Content moderation | 0 SEK |
| **hCaptcha** | Unlimited | Bot protection | 0 SEK |
| **Vercel Analytics** | 2,500 events/month | Basic tracking | 0 SEK |
| **Sentry** | 5,000 events/month | Error monitoring | 0 SEK |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | - | - | **0 SEK** |

### **Scaling Limits (When to Upgrade)**
- **Users**: Free tiers support 100-500 concurrent users
- **Projects**: Up to 200 projects comfortably
- **Emails**: 3,000/month = ~100 emails/day (sufficient for MVP)
- **Database**: 256MB = ~5,000 projects with images stored externally
- **Trigger Point**: When you hit 500+ users or 100+ emails/day

### **Cost Projection (Future Phases)**
- **Phase 2 (Dashboards & Stats)**: 0 SEK/month (database queries only)
- **Phase 3 (PDF Reports)**: ~500 SEK/month (PDF generation service like Pdfmonkey.io)
- **Phase 3 (Payment Processing)**: +0 SEK (Stripe fees ~3% per transaction only)
- **Phase 4 (Scaling)**: +300-500 SEK/month when exceeding free tiers (200-500 users)
- **Phase 4+ (CSRD-Lite)**: +2,000 SEK/month (ONLY if customers explicitly request it)
- **First Paying Customer Should Cover**: 99-299 SEK/month (much more achievable for SMEs)

## üí∞ Business Model & Revenue Projections

### **Strategic Decision: Simple Stats vs CSRD Compliance**

**Decision Made**: Focus on **Simple Stats & SDG-Aligned Reports** for Swedish SMEs, NOT full CSRD compliance software.

**Why This Approach**:
- ‚úÖ **Target market reality**: 95% of Swedish SMEs (0-250 employees) are NOT required to do CSRD reporting until 2026-2027, if at all
- ‚úÖ **Lower complexity**: Simple aggregation & PDF generation vs complex regulatory software
- ‚úÖ **Faster time-to-market**: 2-3 weeks vs 6-12 months development
- ‚úÖ **Lower cost**: 50,000 SEK development vs 1,000,000+ SEK
- ‚úÖ **Volume business model**: 1,000s of customers at 99-299 SEK/month vs 10s of enterprises at 50,000+ SEK/year
- ‚úÖ **Lower support burden**: FAQ & email support vs consulting services
- ‚úÖ **Competitive advantage**: Affordable pricing, Swedish-focused, action-based (not just paperwork)

### **Revenue Projection (Simple Stats Approach)**
```
Target Market: 5,000-10,000 Swedish SMEs (0-250 employees)
Marketing: Content marketing, LinkedIn, word-of-mouth
Conversion Rate: 2% paid conversion (realistic for B2B SaaS)
Expected Paid Customers (Year 1): 100-200 subscribers

Revenue Mix:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic (99 SEK/month): 60% = 60-120 customers = 5,940-11,880 SEK/month
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pro (299 SEK/month): 30% = 30-60 customers = 8,970-17,940 SEK/month
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Premium (999 SEK/month): 10% = 10-20 customers = 9,990-19,980 SEK/month

Monthly Revenue (Year 1): 24,900-49,800 SEK/month
Annual Revenue (Year 1): 298,800-597,600 SEK/year
Total Development Cost: ~50,000 SEK (Phase 2-3)
Monthly Operating Cost: ~1,000 SEK (hosting, services)
Break-even: 3-6 months from launching Phase 3
```

**Path to Profitability**: Clear and achievable ‚úÖ

### **Comparison: Why NOT Full CSRD Compliance**

**IF we built Full CSRD Software** (NOT recommended):
```
Target Market: 500-1,000 Swedish large companies (250+ employees)
Marketing: Enterprise sales, consultants, trade shows
Conversion Rate: 1% (enterprise sales cycles are long & expensive)
Expected Customers (Year 1): 5-10 enterprise customers

Revenue:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Enterprise (50,000-200,000 SEK/year) = 5-10 customers = 250,000-2,000,000 SEK/year

Development Cost: 1,000,000-2,000,000 SEK (12+ months, specialized developers)
Monthly Operating Cost: ~10,000 SEK (regulatory APIs, compliance consultants, insurance)
Sales Cost: 50,000-100,000 SEK per customer (6-12 month sales cycles)
Break-even: 18-36 months (IF you survive)
Competition: SAP, Workiva, Bloomberg ESG (billion-dollar products)
```

**Path to Profitability**: Risky and capital-intensive ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **Business Model Advantages (Simple Stats)**
- ‚úÖ **Volume-based**: Target 1,000s of SMEs, not 10s of enterprises
- ‚úÖ **Affordable pricing**: 99-999 SEK vs 50,000+ SEK enterprise tools
- ‚úÖ **Self-service**: No enterprise sales team needed
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Same product for all customers, minimal customization
- ‚úÖ **Simple support**: FAQ and email, not consulting services
- ‚úÖ **Quick value**: Companies see immediate value (engagement tracking, simple reports)
- ‚úÖ **Emotional appeal**: Support real f√∂reningar, not just regulatory checkbox
- ‚úÖ **Positioning**: "ESG evidence" not "compliance software" (lower liability)
